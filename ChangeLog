----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.7 2017-??-??
- builds again on Solaris
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.6 2017-03-06
- fix small memory leaks in libstdlog
  each open/close leaked a couple of bytes; this was no problem, except if
  they were called very often. However, it was a problem when using memory
  debuggers, which rightfully complained.
- fix BSD build
- enhancement:  sigsafe_printf now recognizes the "j" length modifier
  Thanks to David A. Bright for implementing this
- fix: build_file_line and build_syslog_frame call the __stdlog_print_*
  functions incorrectly
  Change these functions so that they call the __stdlog_print_* functions
  with the correct buffer size.
  see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/33
  Thanks to David A. Bright for the patch.
- Implement a STDLOG_PID option
  ... to specify that each log message should be tagged with the process
  identifier as well as the ident.
  Thanks to David A. Bright for implementing this
- bugfix: potentialSEGV in the stdlog_sigsafe_string formatter
  if NULL pointer was passed in
  Thanks to David A. Bright for the patch
- bugfix: stdlog_sigsafe_printf mis-handles an int or unsigned int
  Thanks to David A. Bright for the patch
- build system: auto-detect presence of journal libraries
  simplifies build for most users. Many complained on mailing list
  about missing journal dependency. Now by default we disable it if
  the libs are not found, what usually is the right thing to do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.5 2014-12-09
- cleanup for systemd-journal >= 209
  closes https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/17
- bugfix: date stamp was incorrectly formatted
  The day part was totally off. This affected the "uxsock:" and "file:"
  drivers.
  closes https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/21
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.4 2014-04-03
- fix build problems on some platforms (namely RHEL/CENTOS 5)
- add --disable-man pages ./configure option
  This permits to totally turn off man page handling. This is useful for
  platforms like RHEL/CENTOS 5 where rst2man is hard to get when building
  from git is desired.
- lower build system requirements to autoconf 2.59
  This permits building on RHEL/CENTOs 5 with stock autotools.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.3 2014-03-18
- fix build problem in Ubuntu 10.04
  Thanks to Assaf Gordon for reporting
  See: https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/11
- do not override user varibale CFLAGS
  Thanks to Thomas D. for reporting this problem and suggesting a solution.
  closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/15
- make liblogging-rfc3195 not export private symbols
  Thanks to Michael Biebl for his help in getting this right.
- explain that stdlog_log() return code usually most not be checked
  (if same level of reliability like syslog(3) is desired)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.2 2014-03-03
- first version of the "real" API of liblogging-stdlog
  It is now feature-complete with multiple channels, signal-safeness, and
  logging drivers for syslog, the systemd journal, unix sockets and files.
  Note: if the journal driver is to be build (enabled by default), a new
  dependency libsystemd-journal exists. This is the required to use the
  journal API. You can turn off building the journal driver via the
  --disable-journal configure option.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1 2014-02-10
- rfc3195 component now 2-clause BSD licensed
  This means the complete liblogging is now under 2-clause BSD
- new component names:
  * liblogging-stdlog
  * liblogging-rfc3195
  made some necessary name adjustments
  See also: https://github.com/rsyslog/liblogging/issues/2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0 2014-01-21
- made rfc3195 library (the original liblogging) an optional component
- add libstdlog component; used for standard logging (syslog replacement)
  purposes via multiple channels (driver support is planned)
  This is the initial bare revision of this library component.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2
   2008-05-07 RGerhards
   - cleaned up some warnings; fixed some potentially bad errors
     thanks to darix for pointing this out
0.7.1
   2008-05-06 RGerhards
   - changed include files (now in liblogging subdirectory)
   - pc file contained wrong package name
0.7.0
   2008-04-15 RGerhards
   - added pkg-config support
   2008-03    Michael Biebl
   - converted to autotools
   2005-10-14 RGerhards
   - There was a bug in the BEEP listeners which made them ignore the
     listen port set by srAPISetOption(). The BEEP listeners always
     listen to 601, no matter what was set.
     
0.6.0
   2005-09-06
   Unfortunately, when I stopped working on liblogging due to some higher
   priority work (in 2003 ;)), I didn't update this file here. While I
   initially thought I'd push it away for a few weeks at most, it actually
   become suspended for some month. The lack of real interest in it didn't
   justify any more work. Thankfully, interest in RFC 3195 is now improving
   and I've also done my own syslogd for unix (www.rsyslog.com), so I am
   now able to look at least partly at the lib. In the mean time, some
   users have successfully used the 0.5.0 release and their feedback was
   generally pleasant. So I think this is a good release.
   I will now go through the code and extract what has been upgraded since
   0.5.0. So we have a rough record of that. Here are the changes:
              - support for UDP and unix domain socket listening - these
                features were initially introduced to support a to-be-written
                syslogd. They are not very well tested and will probably not
                be for quite some time.
              - code enhanced to guard against oversize BEEP frames, which
                could be introduced by a malicous person (security related)
              - some support for Solaris has been added (not sure what it
                was exactly...)
              - added the COOKED listener
              - some checks against invalid SEQs
   0.6.0 is not as thouroughly tested as 0.5.0, which by now I consider to
   be stable. I advise people to use 0.5.0 if they are looking for stable
   code and do not urgently need the new features introduced in 0.6.0.

0.5.0         - fixed a bug in the server code where an <ok/> response
                for a channel close request was sent over the to-be-closed
                channel instead of channel 0. This can be an interoperability
                issue with 
              - implemented 3195/COOKED in the client. Server is still RAW
                only.
              - fixed some smaller bugs I don't remeber ;)
              - enhanced the client API to directly support sending
                syslog message objects. This is now the preferred way
                of sending messages.
              
              THE SERVER API MAY STILL CHANGE AND IS NOT FINALIZED IN 0.5.0!
              
0.4.0	      - fixed a hang condition on server shutdown (the listening
                sockets was accidently not in nonblocking state)
              - added support for parsing the syslog message
              - modified the directory structure, each OS will now have its
                own subdirectory (including Windows)
	          - included a syslog message API, which can also be used
                to create syslog messages
              - added support for syslog-sign-12 in the message object
0.3.1
   2003-08-29 - a good number of fixes
              - server (listener) API included
                WARNING: THE API IS NOT NECESSARILY STABLE YET. If you use it,
                         you may need to change your code with later releases
0.2.0
   2003-08-12 - socket layer restructured to facilitate porting
              - XML parser added
              - API stable, API changes will NOT break any programs written to 0.2.0 API
              - much better error checking
              - compiles & runs under Linux, FreeBSD, AIX, Solaris
     
0.1.0
   2003-08-04 Initial Release
