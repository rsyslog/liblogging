/*! \file sockets.h
 *  \brief socket layer for slim beep
 * 
 * This implements a very thin layer above the socket
 * subsystem. If you intend to port the lib to a
 * different environment, you should probably stick with
 * that layer and create a new socketsXXX.c file.
 *
 * The prefix for this file is sbSock.
 *
 * All methods receive a pointer to their
 * "object instance" as the first parameter.
